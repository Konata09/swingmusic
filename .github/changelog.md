This version adds a few new features and minor bug fixes.

# What's new?

1. Synced lyrics support #126
2. Lyrics finder plugin (experimental)
3. Context option to search artist or album on streaming platforms

### Lyrics support

You can now sing along your music with the new lyrics feature. Click the lyrics button in the bottom bar to view lyrics.

### Lyrics finder plugin

This experimental will find synced lyrics for you. Go to `settings > plugins` to start using it. When lyrics are found, they will be saved to a lrc file in the same directory as the playing track.

# Bug fixes
1. Blank page on safari #155
2. Telemetry has been removed #153
3. Seeking before playing will maintain the position when playback starts
4. A forgotten few

_PS: I also attempted to add a cool fullscreen standby view, but I couldn't animate the images when going to the next/prev track, so I ditched it_
